		<h2 id="cleaning">Clean your room</h2>
			<p>A clean room means that you will actually know where your things are. As a result, you will be more organized and able to accomplish other tasks in a shorter amount of time.</p>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Prioritize. Which mess stands out the most? Deal with that first.</li>
				<li>Put things back where they belong.</li>
				<li>Put back any clothes that are out. <br>Fold them <i>neatly</i>; don't just shove them back in.</li>
				<li>Get rid of any food, especially ones that have already perished.</li>
				<li>Dust, dust, dust. <br>We recommend using a Swiffer Duster but a sock on your hand will do just fine in picking up dust.</li>
				<li>Vacuum the floor or use something like a Swiffer Sweeper <br>Swiffers are the best. Seriously. Get one. Now.</li>
				<li>Don't get sidetracked! <br>Sometimes while cleaning you can get distracted when finding things you hadn't seen in a long time. This can significantly increase the time you spend "cleaning". Stay focused!</li>

		<h2 id="laundry">Laundry</h2>
			<p>Take out your dirty laundry, bring in your clean laundry. This needs to get done eventually, so might as well do it now rather than letting it pile up.</p>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make a habit of doing your laundry once a week, maaaaybe once in two weeks. Pick a designated "laundry" day.</li>
				<li>If managing your own washing machine or dryer, make sure you are stocked in detergents and softeners.</li>
				<li>If sharing washing machines/dryers with others, be considerate of their needs and watch the clock.</li>
				<li>Immediately after taking your clothes out of the dryer, remove the clothes that tend to wrinkle (usually pants, dress shirts, certain long-sleeve shirts) and smooth them out. This prevents them from wrinkling.</li>
				<li>Separate your colors from your whites.</li>
				<li>Be mindful of the washing instructions found on your clothing labels. <br> If it says to wash in cold water, DO IT. Warm water? DO IT. This can save your clothes.</li>
				<li>If you're feeling lonely or sad, take out your clothes out straight from the dryer and bury yourself in their collective warmth. </li>
			</ul>

		<h2 id="hw">Homework/Studying</h2>
			<p>Boring but practical. Spend the rainy day indoors getting homework done, so that when it is nice outside you can go hang out with friends and enjoy the pleasant weather. Plus, it's never too early to start studying!</p>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Find a quiet place so that you can focus.</li>
				<li>Do the easier, less time intensive things first. <br> And get them done quick!</li>
				<li>Don't get stuck on one problem. Move on and come back to it later.</li>
				<li>Prioritize. If your math homework is due tomorrow and your history homework is due next week, do your math homework first.</li>
				<li>Do homework with a friend. <br> But don't break the honor code!</li>
			</ul>
